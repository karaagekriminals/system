Kanban board/issue tracking for the Low Heat music system.

## Instructions

In order to use this repository, you must install the ZenHub browser extension. On the board, you can see the following swimlanes:

- New Issue

Issues start here and should be move out as soon as possible. Every issue should have an Epic attached. Once the issue leaves this swimlane, it should have a Milestone.

- Low Priority

Because this is a hackathon, we need to prioritise MVP. Usually the milestoned epics and issues will be placed in this lane.

- Backlog

Issues and epics that are about to be actioned and moved to progress.

- In Progress

Self-explanatory. At this point, the issue should have an estimate.

- Review/QA

If required before a PR, an issue is ready to be reviewed.

- Closed

The issue is done.
